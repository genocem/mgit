to do (mine):
    prompt for diffrent commit messages for each repo
    
    add fastpush if commit messages is gucci (fastpush is the combination of  -> git add, commit -m and push )

    make some actual documentation ? seems quite obvious to me atm

to do (might do might not just stuff that gpt suggested):
    Repo Filtering:
        Optional flags to target only repos with uncommitted changes, on a certain branch, matching a path, etc.

    Command Template Support:
        Ability to use placeholders like {repo} or {path} in commands.

    Dry Run Support:
        For dangerous commands (e.g., reset --hard), a dry-run preview mode would be useful.
